This is a basic Random Number Generator developed with create-react-app.

I embedded a basic random number generating component into the page, along with the heading and body text. The heading makes use of state objects to render itself.

User is able to navigate to the webage, view randomly generated number, and refresh page as many times as desired to generate more random numbers.

I had some difficulty getting the random number generation function to work. One route that I took relied on react-native components, which I had trouble getting to work in my app, so I took a more basic route that didn't rely on anything outside of React and Babel.

Currently working on deploying app publicly. Will update with link when app is successfully deployed.
